User Story: GiftLink Full-Stack Web Application

As a user who wants to give away or find free household items
I need a comprehensive web platform that connects givers and receivers
So that I can reduce waste by rehoming items I no longer need or find quality pre-owned items without purchasing new ones

Details and Assumptions

- The application serves two primary user types: givers (who want to donate items) and receivers (who want to find free items)
- Users must be able to register, login, and manage their profiles
- The platform includes item listings with detailed information and search capabilities
- The application follows a full-stack architecture with both frontend and backend components
- Users can browse items without registration but need accounts to post listings or contact item owners
- The interface includes: home page, listings page, navigation bar, search functionality, item details page, registration page, login page, and editable profile page
- Items are household goods that are still functional but no longer needed by the original owner
